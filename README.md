## What is this ?

Cryptoshima is a command-line tool meticulously crafted to bolster the security of your BIP-0039 recovery seed phrase. Keeping your seed phrase unencrypted in cold storage can pose significant risks. Leveraging one-time-pad encryption, Cryptoshima empowers you to render your seed phrase completely unreadable to anyone but yourself. It's highly advisable to safeguard the encrypted seed phrase on a physical medium while ensuring the one-time-pad is securely stored in multiple online storage locations.

**Use at your own risk.**

- **encrypt**: Encrypt your BIP-0039 mnemonic, includes a one-time-pad option.
- **decrypt**: Decrypt an encrypted BIP-0039 mnemonic, with a one-time-pad decryption option.
